Agencies in the CBO24 that aren't in the CBO21:
    400 Years of African-American History Commission
    Southeast Crescent Regional Commission
    Southwest Border Regional Commission

"Agencies" in the OMB that aren't in CBO24:
    United States Enrichment Corporation Fund
    Social Security Administration (On-Budget)
    Social Security Administration (Off-Budget)
    Other Independent Agencies (On-Budget)
    Other Independent Agencies (Off-Budget)
    Undistributed Offsetting Receipts
    (On-budget)
    (Off-budget)
    Total outlays

Important to note that in the long format df, only the OMB data is actual outlays. The CBO21 and CBO24 are projections. NaN values fill the gaps. 
    on that note, to match Jame's charts, I added values to the outlays in the year previous to the CBO projections from OMB (so the actual outlays):
    so CBO24 has outlays recorded for 2023 but these are taken from OMB's data
    CBO21 has outlays recorded for 2020 but these are taken from OMB's data
